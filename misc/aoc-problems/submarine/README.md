# Problem 1 : Submarine navigation

Without all the fluff and festive fun of advent of code here is th deets.

1. Your submarine starts at position 0,0 (x position, depth)
1. Parse input to direct your submarine.
1. Multiply your depth \* x progression to get an answer

Example input:

```
forward 5
down 5
forward 8
up 3
down 8
forward 2
```

Note: this means that up 3 is actually -3 from the y axis.
